      <p className="mb-4">There are four primary IDR plans, each suited to different borrower needs. Here's a breakdown:</p>
      <div className="space-y-8">
        <IDRPlanCard
          title="1. SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education) Plan"
          bestFor="Borrowers with undergraduate loans wanting minimal payments"
          calculation="5% of discretionary income for undergraduate loans, 10% for graduate loans"
          uniqueFeature="Payments can be $0, and unpaid interest doesn't capitalize (it won't add to your loan balance)"
          forgiveness="20-25 years, or as little as 10 years for small loans (e.g., $12,000 or less)"
          example="Earning $35,000 yearly with a family of two? Your SAVE payment might be $50/monthâ€”much lower than the standard $300+"
        />
        
        <IDRPlanCard
          title="2. PAYE (Pay As You Earn) Plan"
          bestFor="New borrowers (post-2007) with financial hardship"
          calculation="10% of discretionary income"
          uniqueFeature="Payments are capped at the standard 10-year plan amount"
          forgiveness="After 20 years"
          example="PAYE suits those expecting income growth, as payments won't exceed the standard plan"
        />
        
        <IDRPlanCard

          uniqueFeature="Broad eligibility for federal loan borrowers"
          forgiveness="20-25 years"
          note="Payment percentage varies by when you borrowed"
        />
        
        <IDRPlanCard
          title="4. ICR (Income-Contingent Repayment) Plan"
