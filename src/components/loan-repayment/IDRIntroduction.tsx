        <p>
          Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans are federal student loan repayment options that adjust your monthly payments based on your income and family size. Unlike standard repayment plans with fixed payments, IDR plans make payments affordable—sometimes as low as $0—by tying them to your earnings rather than your total debt. After a set number of qualifying payments, you may also qualify for loan forgiveness.

          If federal student loan payments are straining your budget, IDR plans offer a lifeline by aligning payments with your financial reality.
