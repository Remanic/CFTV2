        <p>
          Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plans are federal student loan repayment options that adjust your monthly payments based on your income and family size. These plans make payments more affordable compared to standard repayment plans, especially if you're struggling financially. They can reduce your monthly bill—sometimes to $0—and may offer loan forgiveness after 20-25 years of payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your student loan payments feel overwhelming, an IDR plan could be your lifeline, helping you avoid default while keeping payments manageable.
