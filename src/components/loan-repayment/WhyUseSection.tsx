        <p className="mb-4">IDR plans come with several advantages:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Affordable Payments:</strong> Monthly payments reflect your income, not your loan balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Loan Forgiveness:</strong> After 20-25 years of payments, your remaining balance may be forgiven.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Payments adjust with income changesâ€”dropping to $0 if you earn little or nothing.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit Protection:</strong> Lower payments reduce the risk of default, preserving your credit score.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These plans are perfect if your student debt feels unmanageable or if you're facing financial challenges.</p>
