      question: "Who qualifies for the Graduated Repayment Plan?",
      answer: "Anyone with federal student loans (Direct, FFEL, or Consolidation) can enrollâ€”no income criteria apply."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do payments go up?",
      answer: "Payments typically adjust upward every two years. Your servicer will outline the exact schedule."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change plans later?",
      answer: "Yes, you can switch plans anytime by notifying your servicer, though exiting an IDR plan might affect forgiveness options."
    },
    {
      question: "Does this plan offer loan forgiveness?",
      answer: "No, forgiveness isn't available under this plan. For forgiveness, explore IDR plans or Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)."
    },
    {
      question: "How does it differ from the Standard Plan?",
      answer: "Graduated Plan: Payments start low and rise over time.\nStandard Plan: Payments stay fixed throughout.\nBoth usually span 10 years, but the Graduated Plan may accrue slightly more interest due to lower initial payments."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my income doesn't grow as planned?",
      answer: "If payments become unaffordable, you can switch to an IDR plan for relief, though you might lose certain prior benefits."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pay extra to finish faster?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Extra payments can be made anytime, penalty-free. Direct them to the principal to cut your balance quicker."
