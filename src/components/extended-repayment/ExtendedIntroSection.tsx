          The Extended Repayment Plan is a federal student loan repayment option that allows you to stretch your repayment term up to 25 years, compared to the standard 10 years. This plan is ideal for borrowers who need lower monthly payments but don't qualify for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans or prefer a longer repayment period without adjusting payments based on income. You can choose between fixed or graduated payments, offering flexibility as your financial situation changes.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          If your goal is to reduce your monthly payments without tying them to your income, the Extended Repayment Plan could be your solution. However, keep in mind that extending your repayment term means paying more interest over time.
