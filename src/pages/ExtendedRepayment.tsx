    },
    {
      question: "How does the Extended Repayment Plan affect the total interest I'll pay?",
      answer: "By extending your repayment term to 25 years, you'll pay more in total interest compared to the Standard 10-year plan. However, your monthly payments will be lower."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I switch to another repayment plan later?",
      answer: "Yes, you can change your repayment plan at any time by contacting your loan servicer. If you switch to an IDR plan, you may regain access to forgiveness options."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there loan forgiveness under the Extended Repayment Plan?",
      answer: "No, the Extended Repayment Plan does not offer loan forgiveness. If you're seeking forgiveness, consider an IDR plan or the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the Extended Repayment Plan compare to other plans?",
      answer: "Extended Plan: Lower payments over a longer term (25 years), with fixed or graduated options.\nStandard Plan: Higher payments over a shorter term (10 years), with lower total interest.\nIDR Plans: Payments based on income, with potential for forgiveness after 20-25 years."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I make extra payments to pay off my loan faster?",
      answer: "Yes! You can make additional payments at any time without penalty. Specify that the extra amount should go toward the principal to reduce your balance faster."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have multiple loans?",
      answer: "If you have multiple federal loans, you can consolidate them into a single loan with a fixed interest rate. However, consolidation may affect your eligibility for certain repayment plans or forgiveness programs."

              <p>
                The Extended Repayment Plan is a federal student loan repayment option that allows you to stretch your repayment term up to 25 years, compared to the standard 10 years. This plan is ideal for borrowers who need lower monthly payments but don't qualify for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans or prefer a longer repayment period without adjusting payments based on income. You can choose between fixed or graduated payments, offering flexibility as your financial situation changes.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                If your goal is to reduce your monthly payments without tying them to your income, the Extended Repayment Plan could be your solution. However, keep in mind that extending your repayment term means paying more interest over time.
